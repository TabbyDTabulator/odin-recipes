                <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>

            <ol>
                <li>Heat cream cheese, sugar, vanilla, salt, and 1/4 cup cream in a small saucepan over medium heat. Cook, whisking often, until melted and smooth, about 5 minutes. Chill, uncovered, until cooled completely, about 20 minutes./li>
                <li>Beat remaining 1/2 cup cream with an electric hand mixer or a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment until stiff peaks form, about 2 minutes. Fold whipped cream into the cooled cream cheese mixture. Spoon into a piping bag, and chill until ready to use.</li>
                <li>Whisk powdered sugar, milk, and vanilla for vanilla drizzle in a medium bowl. Cover until ready to use.</li>
                <li>Crush chocolate sandwich cookies and set aside.</li>
                <li>Whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl.</li>
                <li>Whisk buttermilk, eggs, and vanilla in a large measuring cup; pour over dry ingredients. Gently stir until almost incorporated. Drizzle with melted butter and sprinkle with 2 cups crushed cookies. Stir until just incorporated and some lumps remain. Let batter rest for about 5 minutes.</li>
